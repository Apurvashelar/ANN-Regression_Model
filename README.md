# ANN-Regression_Model  

### Description  
The main purpose of this algorithm is Build an **ANN Regression model** to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. 
That means this model will predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant depending upon the four different independent attributes(features) named as Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V).  
Regression along with ANN gives the continous output.

### Dataset  
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011).
